# Ethernet communication NUCLEO-F767ZI

This application establishes an Ethernet communication between a [NUCLEO-F767ZI](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f767zi.html) board and a computer through a web server generated by the NUCLEO. This work was built based on the tutorial available on this [website](http://ausleuchtung.ch/stm32-nucleo-f767zi-web-server/) and it also runs some functions implemented by Oleksiy Muzalyev. In addition to the configurations required to use Ethernet, as provided by Muzalyev, this application explains in detail the configuration of the web page’s static IP and it configures a PWM signal through Timer3 to trigger an external buzzer. As a result, it is possible to use a computer web browser to access a HTML page through the chosen IP in order to ring the external buzzer in two different pitches and also activate the NUCLEO’s internal LED lights. As an extension of this work, it would be possible to set other frequencies to the buzzer and add more buttons on the HTML page to operate it as a piano.

To change the HTML page, the user must edit the index.html file located inside the folder makefsdata>fs and generate the fsdata.c and fsdata_custom.c files using the command "perl makfsdata.pl" inside the makefsdata folder. Those new files must be included in the project inside the folder Middlewares>Third_Party>LwIP>src>apps>http and then excluded from build. Additional information about the project can be found in portuguese on the AppicationNotePT.pdf file.

This API was developed in August 2021 by Bruno Guimarães Bitencourt and Ian Fernandes Miranda as an assignment for the discipline of Embedded Systems Programming at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG). The classes were taught by professor Ricardo de Oliveira Duarte.
