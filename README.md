# Ethernet communication NUCLEO-F767ZI

This application stablish an ethernet communication between one [NUCELO-F767ZI](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f767zi.html) board and a computer through a web server created by the NUCLEO. This work was based on the tutorial available on this [website](http://ausleuchtung.ch/stm32-nucleo-f767zi-web-server/) and uses some functions implemented by Oleksiy Muzalyev.

This API was developed in August 2021 by Bruno Guimar√£es Bitencourt and Ian Fernandes Miranda as an assignment for the discipline of Embedded Systems Programming at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG). The classes were taught by professor Ricardo de Oliveira Duarte.

# Features
